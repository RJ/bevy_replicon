/// ['ClientEntityMap'] is a resource that exists on the server for mapping server entities to
/// entities that clients have already spawned. The mappings are sent to clients and injected into
/// the client's [`crate::client::NetworkEntityMap`].
///
/// Sometimes you don't want to wait for the server to spawn something before it appears on the
/// client â€“ when a client presses shoot, they can immediately spawn the bullet, then match up that
/// entity with the eventual replicated bullet the server spawns, rather than have replication spawn
/// a brand new bullet on the client.
///
/// In this situation, the server can write the client `Entity` it sent (in your game's custom
/// protocol) into the [`ClientEntityMap`], associating it with the newly spawned server entity.
///
/// Replication packets will send a list of such mappings
/// to clients, which will be inserted into the client's [`crate::client::NetworkEntityMap`].
///
/// ### Example usage:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// // on client:
/// if (pressed_shoot()) {
///     let client_predicted_entity = commands.spawn((Bullet, Prediction)).id();
///     // your game's netcode sends the client entity along with the shoot command:
///     send_shoot_command_to_server(client_predicted_entity);
/// }
/// // on server:
/// fn apply_inputs_system(mut entity_map: ResMut<ClientEntityMap>, tick: Res<RepliconTick>) {
///     // ...
///     if player_input.pressed_shoot() {
///         let server_entity = commands.spawn((Bullet, Replication, Etc)).id();
///         // your game's netcode checks for a client predicted entity, and registers it here:
///         entity_map.insert(
///             player_input.client_id,
///             server_entity,
///             player_input.client_predicted_entity,
///             tick
///         );
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Provided that `client_predicted_entity` exists when the replication data for `server_entity`
/// arrives, replicated data will be applied to that entity instead of spawning a new one.
/// You can detect when this happens by querying for `Added<Replication>` on your client entity.
///
/// If `client_predicted_entity` is not found, a new entity will be spawned on the client,
/// just the same as when no client prediction is provided.
